# 🔐 Simple Login & Sign Up Project

This is a very simple **sign up and login web app** made with:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- LocalStorage to store user credentials (for demo only)

✅ Users can:
- Sign up with username & password  
- Login with saved credentials  
- See success / error messages

⚠️ **Note:**  
This is a practice project — do **not** use for real passwords (uses LocalStorage, not secure).
